# SPCSS Ghost Blog

Inspired by [SPCSS](https://github.com/susam/spcss) from [susam.net](https://susam.net).


## Installation

```
cd ..
zip -r spcss-theme.zip spcss-ghost
cd spcss-ghost
```

Then upload this to your blog


## Common Issues

### Ghost can't find my partials

This happens if you create a zip file without a nested folder. That
means it looks for partials in the wrong place. Your zip file should
open up to one folder, not the files inside that folder.
